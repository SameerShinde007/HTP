                        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
                        <p>Here at HTP, we endeavor to be more than an online retailer and a destination, an experience for you to come and pamper
                            yourself with all your fashion needs. You can buy new as well as pre-owned fashion for women. We desire to inspire, update
                            and inform you of current fashion trends.
                            
                            Let’s face it!! We love to shop and the more we shop, the more stuff we attain and the more stuff we attain, we forget about them
                            and push to the back of our wardrobes.</p>

                        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
                        <p>Our mission is to build a trusted Indian online shopping site with real people behind real profiles – a place to browse and
                            be inspired as well as buy and sell pre-owned designer fashion clothes. Fashion doesn’t come at a cost. Whether it’s
                            the environmental impact of fast fashion or the inaccessibility to the most luxury market, Etashee.com aspires to an alternative.
                            Extend the life of your wardrobe by buying and selling recycled clothing. We aspire to offer our customers an emporium of
                            women’s fashion at swoon-worthy prices. Above all, we want to offer a hassle free shopping experience which is why we
                            uphold a no fuss return policy on every item.</p>
